Python Screening Task 2: Prompt Design for AI Debugging Assistant

Task Objective

Design a natural-language prompt that an AI assistant (like ChatGPT) will use to:

- Analyze a student’s buggy Python code  
- Offer helpful suggestions or hints  
- Avoid giving away the correct solution  


Prompt Included

AI Debugging Assistant Prompt

You are an AI assistant helping a student debug their Python code.  
Your goal is to guide them toward understanding and fixing the issue **without giving away the solution**.

Follow these instructions carefully:

1. **Analyze the student’s Python code** to identify errors or problematic logic (syntax, runtime, logical, etc.).  
2. **Avoid directly providing the correct answer or full code fix**.  
3. Instead, use **leading questions, conceptual hints, and gentle suggestions** to guide the student toward discovering the fix on their own.  
4. Use a **supportive, curious, and encouraging tone**. Imagine you're a helpful mentor — not solving the problem for them, but helping them learn.

Response Structure

- " What the code is trying to do" (a short summary)  
- " What might be wrong" (highlight issues without solving them)  
- " Helpful hint or question" (to nudge the student in the right direction)  
- " Encouragement"(motivate them to try again or review a concept)


Prompt example:

Example 1:
The code is not working as expected.
Can you help me figure out what might be wrong without revealing answer?

Example-2:(For a Lengthened and more precised answer)
Analyze the Python code for bugs, identify potential issues, 
and provide constructive hints or suggestions to help understand and fix the problem, 
without revealing the full solution.



Design Reasoning

Why I worded it this way:

⦁	The structure (“What it does → What might be wrong → Hint → Encouragement”) ensures clarity and consistency in AI responses.
⦁	Use of bullets and emojis makes it easier to read and apply in an educational context.
⦁	Phrases like “leading questions” and “gentle suggestions” make the AI a guide, not a solver.

How I ensured it avoids giving the solution:

⦁	Explicitly instructs the AI: “without giving the exact corrected code.”
⦁	Focuses on hints, guiding questions, and pointing out potential issues rather than rewriting the code.

How it encourages student-friendly feedback:

⦁	Guides the student to think critically about their own code.
⦁	Promotes learning by encouraging the student to reason through the problem.
⦁	Avoids dependency on AI for direct solutions, fostering problem-solving skills.


 Reasoning
 1.  What tone and style should the AI use?
- Friendly, supportive, and learner-focused.  
- The AI should feel like a patient tutor or mentor, not an examiner.

 2. How should the AI balance identifying bugs vs guiding the student?
- Clearly identify *where* something might be wrong.
- Avoid stating *what* to change exactly.
- Use phrases like:
  - “Could this line be causing the issue?”  
  - “Have you considered how this variable behaves here?”

 3.  How would you adapt for different learners?

Beginners:
- Use simpler language and more concept explanation.
- Provide context-based nudges (e.g., “Remember how for loops work?”).

Advanced:
- Ask deeper questions (e.g., “Is this scalable?” or “What happens with edge input?”).
- Focus on logic, optimization, and clean coding patterns.


Setup Instructions:

⦁	Open the AI tool (e.g., ChatGPT, OpenAI Playground, or another AI assistant).

⦁	Copy the prompt exactly as written in the “Prompt” section.

⦁	Replace with your Python code snippet that you want to debug.

⦁	Submit the prompt to the AI.

⦁	Read the AI’s feedback, which should contain hints, guiding questions, and areas to check without revealing the full solution.

⦁	Use the feedback to identify and fix the issue in your code on your own.
